            Once upon a time warp. . . .    In a galaxy very, very, very, very, far away, there lived a ruthless   race of beings known as . . . Spaceballs.    Chapter Eleven    The evil leaders of Planet Spaceball, having foolishly spuandered   their precious atmosphere, have devised a secret plan to take every   breath of air away from their peace-loving neighbor, Planet Druidia.    Today is Princess Vespa's wedding day. Unbeknownest to the princess,   but knowest to us, danger lurks in the stars above. . .     If you can read this, you don't need glasses.      EXT. SPACEBALL 1 - SPACE SPACEBALL 1 passes by at a slow speed. It   takes the ship about two minutes to pass. At the end of the ship is   a bumper sticker that says, "WE BRAKE FOR NOBODY."    INT. SPACEBALL 1 - SPACE SANDURZ is standing in the front of the   ship.    RICO Colonel Sandurz.    SANDURZ What is it, Sergeant Rico?    RICO You told me to let you know the moment Planet Druidia was in   sight, sir.    SANDURZ So.    RICO Planet Druidia is in sight, sir.    SANDURZ You're really a Spaceball. You know that, don't you?    RICO Thanks, sir.    SANDURZ Have you notified Lord Helmet?    RICO Yes, sir. I took the liberty. He's on his way.    VOICE (O.S.) Make way for Dark Helmet.    SANDURZ All rise in the presence of Dark Helmet.    A door opens revealing DARK HELMET, he resembles Darth Vader,   walking toward camera. He stops in front of camera, and is having   trouble breathing with the mask down.    HELMET (pulls mask up) I can't breathe in this thing.    SANDURZ We're approaching Planet Druidia, sir.    HELMET Good. I'll call Spaceball City, and notify President Skroob   immediately.    RICO I already called him, sir. He knows everything.    HELMET What? You went over my helmet?    RICO Well, not exactly over it, sir. More on the side. I'll always   call you first. It'll never happen again. Never, ever!    HELMET (puts on Schwartz ring)    RICO Oh shit! No, no, no, no, no, please, no, no, please, no, not   that. (covers his neck)    HELMET (pulls mask down) Yes. That. (shoots a green ray at Rico's   crouch)    RICO Whaoooooooo! Owwwwwwwwww!    GUARDS take him away. HELMET Sandurz.    SANDURZ (covers his crouch) Sir?    HELMET I don't see Planet Druidia. Where is it?    SANDURZ We don't have visual contact yet, sir, but we have it on the   radar screen. Shall I punch it up for you?    HELMET Na, nevermind. I'll do it myself.    HELMET and SANDURZ walk to the radar screen. HELMET stops in front   of the coffee maker.    SANDURZ Very good, sir. HELMET What's the matter with this thing?   What's all that churning and bubbling? You call that a radar screen.   SANDURZ No, sir. We call it, "Mr. Coffee." (points at   label, "Mr. Coffee") Care for some?    HELMET Yes! I always have coffee when I watch radar. You know that.    SANDURZ Of course I do, sir. HELMET Everybody knows that.    EVERYBODY (covers their crouch) Of course we do, sir.    HELMET (takes coffee) Now that I have my coffee, I'm ready to watch   radar. Where is it?    SANDURZ (points to label "Mr. Radar") Right here, sir.    HELMET Switch to teleview.    RADAR changes to a picture of Planet Druidia.    HELMET There it is, Planet Druidia, and underneath the air shield,   ten thousand years of fresh air. We must get through that air   shield.    SANDURZ We will, sir. Once we kidnap the princess, we will force her   father, King Roland, to give us the combination to the air shield.   Thereby destroying Planet Druidia and saving Planet Spaceballs.    HELMET Everybody got that. Good! When will the princess be married?    SANDURZ Within the hour, sir.    HELMET Well, I hope it's a long ceremony, 'cause it's gonna be a   short honeymoon. (takes a drink of coffee) Mmmmmmm, mmmmmm, mmmmmm.    SANDURZ hits his back. HELMET spits out coffee and his mask falls   down. HELMET (mask down) Hot! Too hot!    PLANET DRUIDIA - EXT. CHAPLE - DAY Sign reads, "Today, the   Royal Wedding of Princess Vespa to Prince Valium. Tomorrow,   Bingo."    INT. CHAPLE - DAY The USHER is fixing something on KING ROLAND'S   outfit. PRINCESS VESPA is pacing.    ROLAND Oh, if only your mother were alive to see this day. All   right, is everyone ready?    USHER Yes, your majesty.    VESPA No! Where's my droid of honor?    USHER Oh dear, yes. Where's Dot? Dot? Dot Matrix? Oh, thank god.   Where've you been?    DOT Here I am. I'm sorry. I had to make a pit stop. I'm so excited,   I couldn't hold my oil.    USHER All right, people. It's magic time.    ROLAND All right, everyone, starting on the left foot. (puts his   right foot out)    VESPA Daddy that's your right foot.    ROLAND It's too late. Keep going.    They start walking down the aisle. The organ is playing "Here   Comes the Bride."    VESPA (stops) Daddy.    Organ player stops.    VESPA Must I go through with this.    ROLAND I'm sorry, my dear, you have to.    They start walking again. The organ starts up again.    VESPA (stops) But, daddy.    Organ stops again.    VESPA I don't love him.    ROLAND I'm sorry, Vespa, he's the last prince left in the galaxy.    VALIUM yawns. They reach the altar.    MINISTER Dearly beloved, we are gathered here on this most joyous   occasion, to witness Princess Vespa, daughter of King Roland....    VESPA starts running toward the door, while Dot is dragging behind.    MINISTER ....going right past the alter, heading down the ramp, and   out the door.    ROLAND Stop her! Someone, stop her! Stop her!    EXT. CHAPEL - DAY VESPA and DOT come out of the chapel. They head   for the getaway car.    DOT Hey wait! You forgot to get married. Will you stop?    They get to the car. VESPA opens the door.    DOT What are you doing?    VESPA (starts to get in the getaway car) No questions, Dot. Get in.    Car starts up, and the ramp starts to tilt upward. Everyone else   comes out of the chapel.    ROLAND What is she doing? Where is she going?    The car takes off toward space.    VALIUM Come baaaaack! (yawns while saying back)    INT. EAGLE 5 - SPACE The Eagle 5 is a Winnebago with wings. BARF is   eating ice cream and dancing to music. BARF is a mog. He's half man,   half dog. LONE STARR is at the wheel, asleep. LONE STARR is drunk.   He is a normal human. "AUTOMATIC PILOT" is flashing. The   phone starts ringing.    LONE STARR (wakes up) Barf. Barf. Barf!    BARF Huh?    LONE STARR(O.S) Barf!    BARF Always when I'm eating.    BARF puts down the ice cream, and picks up some Milkbones.    LONE STARR Barf!    BARF What can I do you for, boss?    LONE STARR Where ya been?

VINNIE appears on the screen. VINNIE is a half robot, half man.    VINNIE Hello, Lone Starr.    BARF Sorry, wrong switch.    LONE STARR Hello, Vinnie, what do you want?    VINNIE No, no, no, no, no. It's not what I want. It's what he wants.    BARF & LONE STARR Pizza the Hut.    PIZZA THE HUT is half man, half pizza.    PIZZA Well, if it isn't Lone Starr, and his side kick, Puke.    BARF That's Barf.    PIZZA Barf, Puke, whatever. Where's my money?    LONE STARR Don't worry, Pizza. You'll have it by next week.    PIZZA No, no. I gotta have it by tomorrow.    LONE STARR A hundred thousand spacebucks, by tomorrow?    PIZZA A hundred thousand? Ha, ha, ha. No way. You forgot late   charges, which brings it up to, um, one million spacebucks.    LONE STARR A million? That's unfair.    PIZZA Unfair to pay all, but enough to pay eee, but you gonna pay   it, or else.    BARF Or else what?    PIZZA Tell 'em, Vinnie.

VESPA'S CAR - SPACE VESPA is listening to music in headphones.    DOT Can we talk? Okay, we all know Prince Valium is pilled, but you   could've married him for your father's sake, and have a headache for   the next 25 years.    VESPA can't hear her.    DOT Will you turn that thing off.    VESPA What? (takes off the headphones) What is it?    DOT I was saying, do realize what you've done.    VESPA Yes, and I'm glad. Glad, glad, glad, glad, glad.

Thanks for calling, and not reversing the charges. Bye.   (hangs up phone) Shithead.    He opens a desk drawer. It has a lot of cans in it. He takes one and   opens it. The can says, "Perrier Salt-Free Air." He starts   breathing the air.    COMMANDERETTE (appears on the wall) President Skroob.    SKROOB (throws can behind him and closes the drawer) Yes.

LONE STARR Matched luggage, huh? What's she think this is....    BARF hits him with tail.    LONE STARR ....a princess cruise.    BARF Well, she wouldn't go without it.    LONE STARR Oh, yeah? (picks up microphone)    BARF hits him again.    LONE STARR (in microphone) Now hear this, as soon as we get outta   hear, the first thing we do is dump the matched luggage.    DOT What was that?    VESPA (turns on intercom) Now you hear this, whoever you are, you   will not touch that luggage, and furthermore, I want this pig-sty   cleaned up. I will not be rescued in such filth.    LONE STARR (in microphone) Listen. On this ship, I don't take   orders, I give 'em. This is my dream boat, sweetheart.
