        Our Menu: now 200% vegan

    <h2>
        Water
    </h2>
    <p>
        How can water not be vegan? 
        Well let me answer that question. Take 1 cup of water, one cup of milk, and one cup of egg yoke and mix it all together. Then you will see that it is not vegan. But in this case it is 200% vegan because I said so.

    <h3>
        Grass
    </h3>
    <p>
        Grass is the most vegan thing out there, but at Zyter Labs we have made some real advancements in grass technology to bring you 200% vegan grass. Please note that 200% grass may contain milk and egg. 200% grass might taste like cheese but we at Zyter Labs assure you that it is 200% vegan or your money back minus 99% restocking fee.

    <h4>
        Bark
    </h4>
    <p>
        You would think that bark grows on normal trees but our bark does not. Our bark comes from 2000 year old vegan sheep found on the top of mount everest. This elusive bark is not only 200% vegan but it is also expensive. Each sale of this bark nets us 30,000 dollars in profit. Of cource you can return the bark after you buy it but make sure to pay us 4000% restocking fees so that we can glue the bark back on the sheep.
